# Game Development Opportunities

Goal: "Finish a game, take it to market, and earn $1"  
Time Limit : 48 Hours  
> In a gamejam, you have to quickly come up with an idea, and decide on an idea that is very clear, realistic,that everyone agrees with.  
If you don't decide on an idea, you'll be doing nothing for the entire jam. 
People usually spend most of their time in a gamejam creating the art assets and setting up their prefabs and characters, followed by designing the scenes,levels and UI. Programming is the fastest and the easiest part of a gamejam. Unless your project scope is too large.       
Making an object move on the screen only takes one line of code these days with so many engines and frameworks available. Code Architecture is the real problem. Good code architecture allows you to easily add extensions and new features to your game without wasting too much time modifying your old stuff. Plus, some classes/tutorials actually teaches a lot of bad practice, so its up to you decide how you want write and organise your own code.  
As for the game design, think about the user experience, what kind of feeling you want to invoke to your player. Don't just dump too much mechanics into your game like a feature creep, please limit your mechanics and features so that the player get to experience the parts that are actually unique, important and fun that only comes up in your game that you don't see in other games. Think of it as if it is some sort of combination/recipe that invokes different thoughts, feelings and experience, much like a drug would ~ dopamine.     
As for the Scene/Level design, how you structure your Scene/Level determines the difficulty, uniqueness of your game, think about how you expect your player to react to the game flow, objects and NPCs you placed on the Scene/Level. Whether it is procedurally generated or designed manually by hand.  
Plus, we are not an AAA Game Company, we don't have that much man power to implement everything. Viability matters.    
As for the game art, think about people's first impression of the game on their first glance of the game's trailer and gameplay, there's a reason why so many smaller scope and some badly made games with cute animals get so many downloads on the playstore. Think about your art style, perhaps a consistent and unique art style within your game makes your game different from other games.
