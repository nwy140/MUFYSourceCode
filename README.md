# Game Development Opportunities

Goal: "Finish a game, take it to market, and earn $1"  
Time Limit : 48 Hours  
> In a gamejam, you have to quickly come up with an idea, and decide on an idea that is very clear, realistic,that everyone agrees with.  
If you don't decide on an idea, you'll be doing nothing for the entire jam. 
People usually spend most of their time in a gamejam creating the art assets and setting up their prefabs and characters, followed by designing the scenes,levels and UI. Programming is the fastest and the easiest part of a gamejam. Unless your project scope is too large.       
Making an object move on the screen only takes one line of code these days with so many engines and frameworks available. Code Architecture is the real problem. Good code architecture allows you to easily add extensions and new features to your game without wasting too much time modifying your old stuff. Plus, some online classes/tutorials actually teaches a lot of bad practice, so its up to you decide how you want write and organise your own code.  
As for the game design, think about the user experience, what kind of feeling you want to invoke to your player. Don't just dump too much mechanics into your game like a feature creep, please limit your mechanics and features so that the player get to experience the parts that are actually unique, important and fun that only comes up in your game that you don't see in other games. Think of it as if it is some sort of combination/recipe that invokes different thoughts, feelings and experience, much like a drug would ~ dopamine.     
As for the Scene/Level design, how you structure your Scene/Level determines the difficulty, uniqueness of your game, think about how you expect your player to react to the game flow, objects and NPCs that are placed on the Scene/Level. Whether it is procedurally generated or designed manually by hand.  
Plus, we are not an AAA Game Company, we don't have that much man power to implement everything. Viability matters.    
As for the game art, think about people's first impression of the game on their first glance of the game's trailer and gameplay, there's a reason why so many smaller scope and badly made games with cute animals get so many downloads on the playstore. Think about your art style, perhaps a consistent and unique art style within your game makes your game different from other games.

~~As a game developer, I can't let anything stop me from doing what I want to, even exams and academics and whatever. I don't continue doing this because someone told me to, I only do this because I want to. Making a living off your passion is what truly matters to me.  
No one told me to become a game developer or an app developer, no one told to me to get a gamedev internship, I do it because I want to. People tell me to go to college, study, do well in exams, do well in college, get a degree all the time, but is that what I truly want?   
But there's good in both side of the table, so the realistic option for me is to continue working on my own side projects, games and apps, that I will release to the playstore, while balancing my academic life.  I mean, why not both? 
I was self taught before I chose to go to University for CS, but to be honest, I'm kinda worried that it will destroy my will and passion to keep working on my side projects. I mean, not everyone is like me, not everyone writes mobile apps/games for fun,  some people are 100% academic, who don't do anything beyond anything outside of the curiculum. 
I'm not sure why some people find CS so hard? Is it because they are pure beginners without any industry experience? Is it because some schools treat CS and textbook algorithms like solving maths equations rather than projects in which you create something for fun.  Maybe that's why so many real world developers drop out, because they have something else to work on, and they don't find college worthwhile. But that doesn't mean I will drop out, I think I prefer to balance my situation, have something going on in your life like a part-time job or a college course so that I will not feel stagnant, while doing what I want only during a specific period like weekends or nightime... 
There's a reason why there are so many self taught developers out there right now, who are making a living off their own projects. Its because of the availability of documentation and open source frameworks, anyone can look up documentation online these days and start learning on their own, not everything has to be learnt in schools anymore. And sometimes, the things you can learn online are much more advanced and interesting than the things you can learn in school. I know that those who goes to schools to learn CS, tend to have a stronger foundation and understanding in theory and textbook algorithms, and they are able to learn and pickup new things really quickly, but some of them lack real world practical experience. I don't think most schools actually teaches you how to use these open source frameworks to develop your owns apps followed with marketing,monetization and publishing them, instead I think they are more focused on textbook algorithms and theory than the practical side of things. Whereas there are many self taught devs out there who already know how to do all these things, and they are making a living off it. The Self taught devs I met are very passionate about what they do and they are always working on their own project in any spare time they have, I'm a self taught dev too before deciding to go to university for CS, so I know what it's like. While your average CS student is just there dreaming about their GPA, who only does assignments when they are given one and not work on any of their own side projects or learn anything else in their spare time, perhaps not every CS Student is like that , I've met CS students who are different though, but I tend to find that people who are not passionate in what they do, to exhibit this kind of behaviour. There's a difference between graduates and talent, and initiative.  If you don't have anything to show to others other than the fact that you are currently a student or a college graduate, then consider yourself average. It is important to create something on your own, make your ideas come true, anything, while you are still learning. Being good at solving textbook questions does not make you anything special, being good at creating your own software, getting it to a production ready level to be shipped, and putting it out there in the market is what makes you special.
That's why the barrier of entry for tech jobs are no longer there, you no longer require a degree, most employers only care about your work experience and your portfolio, and the projects you have worked on and what you created in the past.  
Think about it, what's the difference between a writer who doesn't writes their own books but studies literature and a writer who doesn't studies literature but writes, sells and publishes his books to the market? Its the same thing with programmers/developers, a developer who doesn't write his own software or work on his own projects, is a developer who does not make any real world progress. 
As a game developer, the more games you make, the more you learn, even if you never finished your project and and it becomes an abandonware or your project failed. If you don't start somewhere, you will never learn, you'll never know what its like.
The more you fail, the more you learn. And eventually, you'll get the hang of it, you'll discard the bad practices that have been implanted into your mind and start adopting a better workflow, and eventually, getting a project to a production ready level and taking it to the market is a norm to you.
